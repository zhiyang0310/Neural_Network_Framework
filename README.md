# Neural_Network_Framework
A simplified neural network framwork \n
ComputeLayers.py: Forward and backward propagation for all kinds of layers. \n
Functions.py: Fundamental functions in neural network, for instance, ReLu, softmax, CrossEntropy, and so forth. \n
TrainMethod.py: Traning strategies. Currently support SGD, Momentum, and AdaGrad. \n
